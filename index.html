            <div class="bigfactbox"id="kobefactsbox1">Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Named after a Japanese steakhouse, Kobe Bryant is the son of former NBA player Joe "Jellybean" Bryant. In 1984, after ending his NBA career, the elder Bryant took the family to Italy, where he played in the Italian League

            </div>
            <div class="bigfactbox" id="kobefactsbox2">He spent most of his early age in Italy because the elder Bryant shifted his entire family to Italy after his retirement. For this reason, Kobe Bryant is very fluent in his Italian and uses the language a lot to interact with his teammates during the match. He began to learn Italian quickly majorly because he wanted to fit in with the other kids in his school in Italy.

            <div id="kobefactsbox3">Bryant’s middle name is different from what appears on his birthday certificate and other documents. The middle name chosen by his parents was “bean” from his father’s nickname Jelly Bean, but it was not officially written down in the documents.He returned to his hometown in 1991 and took admission in Merion High School. It was here that he was properly able to show his talent as a basketball player when he won four championships in a row.

            <div class="bigfactbox" id="kobefactsbox4">He was the first ever guard who had been drafted out of high school and directly into the team. This was a big milestone not only for Bryant but also for the Merion High School. However, the Charlotte Hornets who drafted Bryant originally traded him for Vlade Divac, which was the only wrong thing that happened to Bryant on draft day.Kobe Bryant married Vanessa Laine in 2001; the two originally met in 1999 when Vanessa was a high school student. She was acting as a background dancer for music videos at that time and Bryant had come to the studio to get a rap song recorded. The song never released but the visit got him to his future wife.
